1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, the main problem I tackled was to design and implement a program that could read, store, and display the course information for a Computer Science program. This involved reading data from a file, processing it, and storing it using one of three data structures: a Binary Search Tree, a Hash Table, or a Vector. The program needed to print the course information along with their prerequisites in an alphanumeric order, which required efficient data management and sorting.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To address the problem, I decided to use vector sorting as my primary data structure due to its efficiency in handling ordered data. Data structures are crucial because they provide a means to manage data in a way that enhances performance and scalability. In this project, understanding data structures helped me design algorithms that could efficiently read, store, and sort the course data. Vector sorting, for example, facilitated quick access and organization of elements, making it easier to manage large datasets and ensure the data was processed and displayed correctly.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the project, I encountered several roadblocks, particularly related to defining functions and handling errors in the code. To overcome these challenges, I relied heavily on the pseudocode I created before writing the actual code. This provided a clear roadmap and helped me systematically design the program. Additionally, feedback from my instructor was invaluable, as it highlighted areas for improvement and provided guidance on best practices. The course materials and lessons from zyBooks were also instrumental in helping me understand and resolve the issues I faced.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has significantly enhanced my approach to software design and program development. I learned the importance of using the right methods, classes, and data structures to create efficient and effective code. The project taught me how to implement loops correctly and utilize object-oriented programming principles to improve code organization and reusability. This experience has broadened my understanding of coding best practices and has strengthened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through this project, I have gained a deeper appreciation for writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. Applying Object-Oriented Programming principles allowed me to create reusable and flexible code structures. As a beginner, I learned the value of clear and organized code, which not only makes it easier to maintain and debug but also enables other developers to understand and build upon my work. Using data structures effectively helped manage data efficiently, ensuring that the program could handle various operations such as loading, retrieving, and displaying course information seamlessly.

Final Thoughts
This project has been a transformative experience, enhancing my coding skills and understanding of software development. It has prepared me to tackle more complex programming challenges and has instilled in me the importance of using appropriate data structures and coding practices to create robust and scalable applications.
